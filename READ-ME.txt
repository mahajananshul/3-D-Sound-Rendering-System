a) Using experimentally measured HRIRs
	i) Time domain convolution equation for FIR causal filters.
		CODE:
			For Azimuth:  see "time_domain_convo_azimuth_re.py"
			For Elevation: see "time_domain_convo_elevation_re.py"
		OUTPUT AUDIO FILES:
			For Azimuth:  see "time_domain_azimuth.wav"
			For Elevation:  see "time_domain_elevation.wav"
	ii) Frequency domain FIR filtering using the “overlap and add” block processing method.
		CODE:
			For Azimuth:  see "frequency_domain_convo_azimuth_re.py"
			For Elevation: see "frequency_domain_convo_elevation_re.py"
		OUTPUT AUDIO FILES:
			For Azimuth:  see "frequency_domain_azimuth.wav"
			For Elevation:  see "frequency_domain_elevation.wav"
b) Using HRIR filters designed from a basic synthetic model of HRTFs: 
	CODE:
		for frequency domain: see "frequency_hrtf_re.py"
		for time domain: see "time_hrtf_re.py"
	OUTPUT AUDIO FILE:
		for frequency domain: see "frequency_hrtf.wav"
		for time domain: see "time_hrtf.wav"
